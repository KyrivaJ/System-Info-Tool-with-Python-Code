# System-Info-Tool-with-Python-Code
A small python tool I coded that displays the CPU, RAM, and Network Info. You can also save it into a text document with one of the folders. Feel free to use and modify it yourself if, you'd like. I am also open to criticism so I can improve and learn stuff I didn't know of before :)
